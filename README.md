# SonosAPI

I love the Sonos Player but Sonos miss some specials, that I want to have so I wrote it for me.
First the Base of this Project where the Intel UPNP C# Lib, the Taglib-sharp and the Jishi Lib (https://github.com/jishi/Jishi.Intel.SonosUPnP)
IÂ´m not native english speaker so much Comments are written in German and much Stuff in here is for me but maybe there a some folks, that say, hey this is cool
and we can work on it thogether. If so I will translate the comments.

So what will you found on this Project.
The Backend is a ASP MVC API Project wich will Discover the Sonos Player and hold and read the needed Informations. 
Then you have a Javascript Based Frontend with REsponsive Design for Apple Devices. 

But what is the different to the normal Sonos Controler? 
I read, with the taglib, the Metainformation of you local stored Song. If you tagged it with Lyric, Rating (popm) or the Label, you got it on the
Frontend. If you not have tagged it jet, no Problem. On the Frontend you can set Rating for the Mood,Situation,Tempo and there a two Star Ratings. 
I wrote it for My Wife and me.

I think the last special is the export of one Playlist to a M3U Playlist.

In the Project there are two more none directly Sonos Projects.

For my rated Songs I have wrote a ugly WPF Playlistgenerator with only German Frontend wich can generate Playlists for me like
all Songs with Rating > 3 AND NOT Genre Christmas AND Tempo FAST AND Situation Party


The last Project ist a Amazon Dashbutton Watcher that call on Button-Click the SonosAPI and Make some Stuff on my House. 


So and now some last Words. Is my first git/github Project. I hope it help someone to save Time.
If you have Questions, I hope we can find the awnser. 
Have fun
